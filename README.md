# 11ty Coffee Site

This is a test site that I'm putting together to figure out the ins and outs of 11ty. It is a work in progress, and may never be finished :)

## 11ty Sass Skeleton

I used the [11ty Sass Skeleton](https://github.com/5t3ph/11ty-sass-skeleton) by [@5t3ph](https://twitter.com/5t3ph) to get started. More of her awesome 11ty content is linked down below.

Thanks for all your awesome resources Steph :D.

## Development Scripts

**`npm start`**

> Run 11ty with hot reload at localhost:8080, including reload based on Sass changes

**`npm run build`**

> Production build includes minified, autoprefixed CSS

Use this as the "Publish command" if needed by hosting such as Netlify.
